Hi! My name is Seth, and I am one of the founders of AccessPoint.

As of the day I write this (December 31st, 2024), we are still in the early stages of getting set up and defining what AccessPoint will look like in the future.

Right now, my co-founder and I intend to make AccessPoint a place for undervalued students to apply to colleges. It’s intended to be a guide for high-achieving high schoolers to apply to college when their circumstances don’t set them up to do so.

Both of my parents are Hispanic immigrants and up until recently, had not completed college (I’m super proud of my dad). They had no experience with the process of applying to upper-level colleges. They didn’t know anything about last-dollar scholarships, college fly-ins, early admission, early decision, scholarship displacement, or any of the other fancy terms I have come to learn about.

A sophomore at MIT now, I know about the process decently well. I’m hoping to share the knowledge I’ve gained. This knowledge has helped me and others get into various top-tier colleges. I hope it helps you too.
